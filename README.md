# Detection-Net
Embedded Systems Project - y2022/2023 - in collaboration with M. Morales  

For this project, we had to imagine, design and realise our own embedded system.  
  
We chose to make a Detection Net, using light as a way to detect the presence of someone on the net, with a screen showing a dot where a person has been detected, and a camera moving towards the direction where the person has been detected, thanks to a stepper motor.  
  
You will also find in this repository our project report, explaining everything about this project : how each component works and has been added to the project, visual representations of our PCB card in 3D with Altium, and more. (only available in French)  
  
This projet being an embedded systems project, the program will not do anything alone. You can always try to recreate our system by yourself with the help of our project report though !
