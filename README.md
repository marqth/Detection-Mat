# Detection-Net
TIPE Project - y2021/2022 - in collaboration with M. Morales  

For this project, we had to imagine and create our own embedded system.  
  
We chose to realise a Detection Net, using light as a way to detect the presence of someone on the net, with other features.  
  
With this program, you will go through a homepage, a tutorial explaining briefly how the simulation works, a menu where you can play on various parameters, and activate or not some others, and finally, the simulation itself, evolving in real time after starting it.  
  
You will also find in this repository our project report, explaining everything about this project : how each component works and has been added to the project, visual representations of our PCB card in 3D with Altium, and more. (only available in French)
  
To use this program :  
  
Be sure you have an IDE that can run .CPROJECT files in the first place (We used STM32CubeIDE 1.7.0 for our project)  
Then, download the folder SEITM_EN if you want the English version of the program, or SEITM_FR if you want the French one  
Finally, in both cases, after unzipping the folder you just downloaded, open the "seitm5.py" file in your IDE, and run the program !
